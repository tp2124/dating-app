# ASP.NET Core

# Angular
## Shortcuts
* Creating component: use the right click in the Solution Explorer `Create Component` and this will stub in the required changes and referneces.

## Concepts
### Forms
Forms can support 2 way bindings from the template (HTML) to the form.
* `name=<string>` is required by Angular to designate form controls.
There are 2 types of forms:
* `Template` - Meant to be simpler
    * `#loginForm="ngForm"` into the `<form>` tag.
* `Reactive` 
#### States
* Valid: Successfully meeting all validation criteria. This is dictated by other attribtes. Example: `[disabled]`
* Touched: Something has been typed and focus has left the form.
* Dirtied: Something has been typed into the form.
