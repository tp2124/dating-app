# Packages
## AlertifyJS: alertifyjs.com
This gives us notification bubbles.
* To Install, `npm install alertifyjs`

## auth0/angular2-jwt https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt
This gives us easier time interacting with Jwt tokens and decoding them.
* To Install, see the README.md. The current command is `npm install @auth0/angular-jwt`
* As the username is encoded in the token, we can extract this and store it in the authServie when we're handling the token. This will save us a trip to any API's to get the username as a request from the APIs.

## NGX Bootstrap https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap
We're using this to avoid using JQuery (normally would be BootstrapJS with typical HTML application) with Angular (it's rather counter productive and a hot topic debate).
* To Install, `npm install ngx-bootstrap --save`

## Bootswatch https://bootswatch.com/
Style themes that are free that are meant to work with Bootstrap.
* To install, `npm install bootswatch`
