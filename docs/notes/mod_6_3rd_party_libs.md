# Packages
## AlertifyJS: alertifyjs.com
This gives us notification bubbles.

## auth0/angular2-jwt https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt
This gives us easier time interacting with Jwt tokens and decoding them.
* To Install, see the README.md. The current command is `npm install @auth0/angular-jwt`
* As the username is encoded in the token, we can extract this and store it in the authServie when we're handling the token. This will save us a trip to any API's to get the username as a request from the APIs.

## Angular Bootstrap https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap
Avoiding to utilize JQuery with Angular (it's rather counter productive and a hot topic debate).
